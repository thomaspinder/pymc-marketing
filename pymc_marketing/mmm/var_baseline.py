class VARBaselineEffect(MuEffect):
    """Latent sales baseline that moves with brand metrics through a Bayesian VAR.

    Brand marketing builds mindset metrics such as awareness and consideration, and
    those metrics move the sales baseline over the long term [1]_. This effect adds
    that baseline to the MMM's mean as a latent series and fits it jointly with the
    rest of the MMM. Its prior is a vector autoregression (VAR) over the baseline and
    the brand metrics, with inputs such as brand spend as exogenous regressors, built
    by Impulso's ``VAR.build_in_model``. The
    :ref:`brand metrics notebook <mmm_brand_metrics_long_term>` fits the same model
    in two stages: an MMM whose time-varying intercept estimates the baseline, then a
    VAR on that estimate.

    The brand data sit beside the MMM's data rather than in ``X``. Brand trackers
    often cover other periods than the MMM, or come at another cadence, so they stay
    out of ``X``, and the effect matches their rows to the MMM's dates. A forecast of
    the baseline would need new brand data anyway. The brand data are therefore
    constants in the graph, not data in the MMM's ``constant_data``.

    The VAR runs on the baseline in the target's original units and on the brand
    columns in their own units, centered on their means over the MMM's dates. The
    baseline equation has no intercept, so the baseline is a zero-mean deviation
    around the MMM's intercept. Its own first-lag coefficient has prior mean
    ``baseline_own_lag_mean`` rather than the Minnesota prior's random walk.

    The baseline responds to the centered brand metrics and exogenous inputs, so the
    MMM's intercept absorbs the brand's average effect. When a brand metric that
    raises sales, such as consideration, is below its mean, as between brand
    flights, it pushes the baseline below zero. The ``{prefix}_effect`` column of
    ``mmm.compute_mean_contributions_over_time()`` is therefore a deviation, not the
    sales the brand caused, and it sums to about zero over time.

    The first ``lags`` values of the baseline have a normal prior with mean 0 and
    standard deviation ``s / sqrt(1 - baseline_own_lag_mean**2)``, in the target's
    original units, where ``s`` is the residual standard deviation of an AR(1) fit to
    the target. That is the baseline's stationary standard deviation if it were an
    AR(1) with own-lag coefficient ``baseline_own_lag_mean`` and innovation standard
    deviation ``s``. The start of the path trades off against the MMM's intercept, so
    it gets the scale of the rest of the path rather than a looser one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    brand_data : pd.DataFrame
        The brand metrics and exogenous inputs, with the MMM's date column. Rows are
        matched to the MMM's dates on that column, so they can be in any order and
        cover other dates too. Construction checks only that the columns named in
        ``endog_names`` and ``exog_names`` exist and are numeric. Building the MMM
        checks that, on the MMM's dates, those columns are finite and vary, and that
        there is exactly one row per MMM date. Rows on other dates are neither used
        nor checked, so they may hold NaN or repeat a date. The dates must match the
        MMM's in time-zone awareness: both naive or both aware. The effect keeps a
        copy of the frame.
    baseline_name : str
        Name of the latent baseline in the VAR. It must not be a column of
        ``brand_data``.
    endog_names : list[str]
        The VAR's endogenous series in order: ``baseline_name`` first, then at least
        one column of ``brand_data``.
    exog_names : list[str]
        Columns of ``brand_data`` that enter the VAR as exogenous regressors. May be
        empty. No name may appear twice across ``endog_names`` and ``exog_names``.
    prefix : str
        Prefix for the effect's variables. The VAR's variables are named
        ``{prefix}::B``, ``{prefix}::latent`` and so on, and the baseline's
        contribution is ``{prefix}_effect_contribution``.
    var : impulso.VAR
        The VAR specification, with an integer ``lags``, constant volatility and
        Gaussian errors. It is not modified.
    baseline_own_lag_mean : float, default 0.0
        Prior mean of the baseline's own first-lag coefficient, strictly between -1
        and 1 because the baseline is a stationary deviation. The effect sets the
        baseline's entry of a Minnesota prior's ``own_lag_mean`` to it. A scalar
        ``own_lag_mean`` applies to every brand metric. A per-series
        ``own_lag_mean`` must start with this value, or construction raises. Any
        other prior keeps its own-lag means. It also sets the standard deviation of
        the start of the baseline's path.

    Notes
    -----
    The baseline exists only on the dates the MMM is fitted on. On those dates,
    fitting, the contribution decomposition, the MMM's summaries and posterior
    predictive sampling work. Channel incrementality is not supported yet. The
    budget optimizer runs on any window but ignores the baseline, as it should: brand
    spend is an exogenous input of the VAR, not a channel. Posterior predictive
    sampling and ``predict`` on other dates are not supported, and they fail inside
    PyTensor with an error that does not name the effect.

    The MMM must have no ``dims``, ``time_varying_intercept=False`` and
    ``link="identity"``, and building any other MMM raises. The VAR has no
    cross-sectional dimension, so it models a single panel. A time-varying intercept
    would compete with the baseline, which is a deviation around a constant
    intercept. The baseline enters the MMM's mean additively in the target's units,
    which holds only on the identity link.

    The brand metrics' likelihood and the constraint that keeps the baseline
    stationary are potentials, which prior and posterior predictive sampling ignore.
    Prior predictive baseline paths therefore come from the untruncated prior and can
    explode, and the brand metrics are never drawn. Posterior predictive sampling
    warns that it ignores them, which is harmless here: it draws from the posterior,
    which the potentials shaped.

    PyMC's NUTS sampler and nutpie work. ``nuts_sampler="numpyro"`` and
    ``nuts_sampler="blackjax"`` fail at the first gradient evaluation with JAX's
    ``NotImplementedError``: "Derivatives of non-symmetric eigenvectors are only
    valid under assumptions on the input that JAX cannot check". JAX differentiates
    the eigendecomposition in the stationarity constraint, which PyTensor's gradient
    treats as a constant. The fix belongs in Impulso, see
    https://github.com/QuantClimate/Impulso/issues/378.

    An MMM takes at most one ``VARBaselineEffect``, and building an MMM with two
    raises. Two baselines in one mean would be identified only through their sum,
    and two VARs over the same brand series would count those series' likelihood
    twice, so put every brand series in one VAR.

    Impulso adds a positional ``time`` coordinate that no variable uses.
