"""Vector autoregression (VAR) baseline support, built on Impulso.

`Impulso <https://github.com/QuantClimate/Impulso>`_ is an optional dependency of
PyMC-Marketing, and the VAR baseline needs ``impulso>=0.1.3``. Install it with
``pip install 'pymc-marketing[var]'``. This module imports Impulso only when it is
used, so PyMC-Marketing imports without it.
